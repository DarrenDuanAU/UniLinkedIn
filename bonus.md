1. A **navigation bar** is made on home page, which will **stay on the screen** when users scrolling down.
2. Once a user logged in, the **user's name will be shown in header**, which is straightforward to know who logged in.
3. When **multiple comments** are posted for one job, they will be **ordered chronologically**, which means the newest comment shown at the top.
4. **Light/Dark mode** can be applied. (Users can switch to light/dark mode to change the theme color(light yellow/dark green) by clicking a button).
